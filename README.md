# Public Sentiment

As world organizations work around the clock to develop a vaccine to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, letâ€™s look at how people around the world prepare to accept or reject a vaccine. There are anti-vaxxer movements which fight against the use of vaccinations. Considering whether these movements can jeopardize the distribution and intake of vaccines or it will have any power to have an effect at all. 

Task is to develop a machine learning algorithm to monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 and detect if posts related to vaccinations are positive, neutral or negative. 
This can help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.

The dataset contains 10001 tweets from twitter which contains tweet_id, safe_text, label and agreement taken from Zindi.
